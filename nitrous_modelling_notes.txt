Random idea for modelling nitrous injector mass flow rate when injector pressure is lower than tank vapor pressure:
Been using pyfluids to create a few nitrous instances, one for tank, injector and chamber

Problem was before that previous implementation of HEM & NHNE models do not work for nitrous below saturation, as it was just using temperature at saturation for a given vapor pressure and pressure, so any pressure below this would mean it solves to be in the gas phase only

Can get around this using the following (Assuming all processes are isentropic):

1. update the tank instance for properties at the end of nitrous filling (saturated in tank) with 2 inputs: (Either vapor pressure or temperature) and vapor quality (0 for saturation)

2. model the isentropic compression by updating tank instance with 2 inputs: saturated entropy, supercharge pressure - only needs to be done if supercharged
Interesting notes from this: The nitrous temperature will increase slightly due to compression, but only by like a few deg K max even for 10s of bar supercharge

3. update injector instance with 2 inputs: tank entropy, injector pressure
The vapor pressure of the fluid at this point will be equal to the injector pressure, since the nitrous will expand and some liquid will boil, causing the fluid to cool down, decreasing vapor pressure
Density will drop too, and will be lower than the equivalent density for saturated liquid at the same pressure due to two phase flow

4. update chamber instance with 2 inputs: injector / tank entropy (they're the same), chamber pressure

5. calculate kappa, the weighting of SPI and HEM mdot for the NHNE model, for our case where the fluid is two phase in the injector, the vapor pressure is equal to the injector pressure, so kappa = 1, which corresponds to equal weighting of SPI and HEM mdot

6. calculate SPI and HEM mdot, use this to calculate NHNE mdot using kappa

The above assumes isentropic processes for everything but the injector orifice flow, with injector orifice flow the NHNE model uses kapa to weight SPI and HEM mdot based on the residence time in the orifice which will dictate the amount of flash boiling, since it is not an instantaneous process, however for the case of nitrous flowing through plumbing it will have a much higher residence time, so isentropic should hopefully fine. The only part I'm unsure on for this is if the value of kappa calculated is valid for two phase flow at the injector already since I haven't seen this done anywhere
